# A-GUI-based Python-Sentiment-analysis-using-NLTK

The GUI-based sentiment analysis project using Python, NLTK, and Matplotlib is a program that takes a "review" dataset and returns the sentiment analysis of the text. The program has a user-friendly interface that allows the user to enter any text, and then the program uses the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library to analyze the text and determine the sentiment. The sentiment analysis is done using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool, which is a rule-based sentiment analysis tool specifically designed for social media text.

The program uses Matplotlib to display the sentiment analysis results in a graphical format. The graphical representation of the sentiment analysis results shows the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments of the input text.

Overall, the project is a great way to demonstrate how to use Python, NLTK, and Matplotlib to build a GUI-based sentiment analysis tool. It can be used by anyone who wants to analyze the sentiment of a given text and get a quick overview of its emotional tone.
